<p> But what if you don't have a validation code or you lost it? Is there a way to get a free validation code for QuickBooks Pro 2013? </p>
<p> The answer is yes, but you need to be careful. There are many websites that claim to offer free validation codes for QuickBooks Pro 2013, but most of them are scams that can harm your computer or steal your personal information. </p>
<p> The only safe and legal way to get a free validation code for QuickBooks Pro 2013 is to contact Intuit Customer Service at 1.800.316.1068[^1^]. They will ask you some questions to verify your identity and your purchase of QuickBooks Pro 2013. If everything checks out, they will give you a validation code that you can enter in the software to activate it. </p>
<p> However, there are some limitations to this method. First, you need to have a valid license number and product number for QuickBooks Pro 2013, which you can find on the original packaging or on your online account. Second, you need to have purchased QuickBooks Pro 2013 from a reliable source or retailer, not from a second-hand or unauthorized seller. Third, you need to call Intuit Customer Service within the support period, which is usually three years after the release of the software. </p>
<p> If you don't meet these requirements, you may not be able to get a free validation code for QuickBooks Pro 2013 from Intuit Customer Service. In that case, you may need to buy a new license or upgrade to a newer version of QuickBooks. </p>
<p> Alternatively, you can try some of the online tools that claim to generate free validation codes for QuickBooks Pro 2013, but be very cautious. These tools may not work or may contain viruses or malware that can damage your computer or compromise your security. Some of them may also require you to complete surveys or download other programs that can be harmful or unwanted. </p>
<p> Therefore, we do not recommend using these tools unless you are absolutely sure that they are safe and trustworthy. You should always scan any file that you download with an antivirus program and avoid clicking on any suspicious links or pop-ups. You should also backup your data and create a restore point before using any of these tools, in case something goes wrong. </p>
<p> In conclusion, the best way to get a free validation code for QuickBooks Pro 2013 is to contact Intuit Customer Service at 1.800.316.1068[^1^] and provide them with your license number and product number. However, this method may not work if you don't have these numbers or if you bought QuickBooks Pro 2013 from an unreliable source or after the support period ended. In that case, you may need to buy a new license or upgrade to a newer version of QuickBooks. Alternatively, you can try some of the online tools that claim to generate free validation codes for QuickBooks Pro 2013, but be very careful and use them at your own risk.</p>
